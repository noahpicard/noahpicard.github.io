Cool Girl


my back hurts from the exercises
I'd tried to replicate from taekwondo
creaking, folding over like a human futon
doobs laughed from the airbnb kitchen
he would leave as soon as he 
finished ordering her oatmilk latte


I must have pulled something; a pinching
coils up either side of my spine 
from hip to shoulder
it's not so bad i guess
we rearranged the chairs in the room
in order to fit in her field of vision


she couldn't sleep the night prior
but she'd found my workout playlist on spotify
it felt like I was with her
she enjoyed guessing which woman in my life
had precipitated the addition
of Tove Lo's dance hit Cool Girl


while you were out of the room
she criticised doobs for being
late with the coffee
"you have to be here when you say you'll be--
five minutes feels like an hour"


I didn't tell her that Cool Girl 
isn't about anyone in particular
but rather the mythical posturer 
I prefer to project on anyone who
appears more together than myself
she said the hardest part was
trying to piss herself
while the nurses watched


doobs kept asking if she could feel her toes yet
but she wanted to hear about the restaurants we
attended downtown, if the food was something
she would have liked


last night I couldn't sleep
at 5am I laid an heat pack on my mid-back
and scanned the bedframe searching for grief
like a lost earplug


she'd had a revelation before she'd gone under
she had kicked you and doobs out
to tell me


I didn't tell you what she told me
I don't think it would have 
changed anything if I had


then she asked me to make her a playlist
just for her
I squeezed her blotchy hand
she said she was slow enough now to 
really take the music in
