I know you asked me already


and I answered already but I feel
something needs to be flushed out in full
so, simply:


it is the brush on your fingers webbing
& in the fingertips brushing 
        it is the edges of film in the home video
        and thumb that gets in the shot
                it is the tune rolling tidally
                over behind your lips
                        it is the slimy clasped can
                        and the gloved hand
                                it is watching the stars to check
                                which ones might go out soon~replace,needs to be flushed out in full,is flushing me out
                                and thanking them for stopping by
        & it is the memory
        behind the memory~replace,([A-Za-z]+)ing,$1ed
