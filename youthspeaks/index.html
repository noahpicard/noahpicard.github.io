          Before the crisis I was studying at school. Sometimes it was difficult because the Buddhist children would throw stones at us on our way to school.<br><br>
    My favorite subject is Burmese, because it is the language of my country and if I want to live there I will need it to communicate with my neighbors.<br><br>
    We were sleeping one night when the military came to our village and started firing their guns. One soldier entered our house and started taking our money and jewelry.<br><br>
    My brother-in-law complained so they started beating with him a stick and then arrested him.<br><br>
    I felt very sad at that moment because they were hitting him and because we could not do anything except watch. I went with my sister to the police station to ask them to release him, but they started beating her too. It was horrible.<br><br>
    Because they burned our house and took our money we had to move to Bangladesh. I did not want to go to Bangladesh, but my mother made me.<br><br>
    We were walking for four days and did not eat anything.<br><br>
    The road was very muddy and we walked though lots of villages that had been burned to the ground.<br><br>
    My sister did not come with us because of her husband. She would prefer to die than leave him behind.  I am really afraid for her because if the military do anything to her we can’t help her.<br><br>
    I am very unhappy here because we are stuck and sleeping on a muddy field.

          Before this crisis I was studying at the madrassa. I liked learning about the holy Quran and I hoped to teach Islamic studies to other people once I graduated.<br><br>
    On August 25th, ARSA (<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/12/asia/arsa-rohingya-militants-who-are-they/index.html" target="_blank">Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army</a>) and the military started fighting in my village.<br><br>
    We had to run because the military were firing their guns at us, and one of their bullets hit me in the head. <br><br>
    I don’t really know what happened next because I passed out -- it was so painful.<br><br>
    My neighbors must have carried me to the clinic where they gave me some medicine, then my family started walking to Bangladesh.<br><br>
    I was still feeling weak, so they gave me a walking stick.<br><br>
    I miss my village very much. I really want to go back so I can continue with my education.<br><br>
    I don’t really like it in Bangladesh because my whole family has to live under a sheet of plastic and there is not enough room for all of us.
