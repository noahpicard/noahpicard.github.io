I have a resume



We need a new playspace.



Website with video that autoplays, and which autoscrolls. When you scroll up or down it goes to that part in the video

Get the persons name, and then refer to them by their first name throughout the site.

Use persons name at end to create a small art piece to present them with. 

Freescrolling left-right, up down in space.
