March 8 2025 - the kitchen of 700 Broderick
you call me back a day later at 12:08
the near-spring sun slow cooking my pant legs
a warbling by my kitchen window
two rock doves nitpicking / arguing / circling
the way you and grandma used to do
in the house on the hill with the earth brick floors
her in the chair~setLine,1,you call me back at 12:08
