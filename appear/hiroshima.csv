300,French,5,,,,,,,,"I might not be a great fan of the French New Wave, but sure I am not a fan of this film. Romantinc, poetical but too heavy for my tastes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
300,Japanese architect,5,,,,,a foredoomed romance between a French actress and a Japanese architect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
300,Hiroshima,5,"They regard the war, Hiroshima, each other, and even themselves with what seems like boredom. Maybe that's the point though? Or maybe the film was just lost on me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

300,of,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The educated audience often uses “art” films in much the same self-indulgent way as the mass audience uses the Hollywood “product,” finding wish fulfillment in the form of cheap and easy congratulation on their sensitivities and their liberalism.",,,

300,hours,10,,,,,,,,,,,,"I am not one for melodrama, but this piece had me convinced it was something special. Then it kept going. And going. And getting more ridiculous. For hours. And more ridiculous. It is pretty innovative for it's time, however, but it is a bore to watch. A barely passable film-watching experience.",,,,,,,,,,,
