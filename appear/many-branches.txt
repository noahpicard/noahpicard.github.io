named you many-branches
god swaying breeze-wise
light dappled capturing patches
‘cross lichen smattered sage-yellow
two scalloped twigs split infinite
wishbone - to make true is to fragment
but each bough rebonds to that broader trunk
dubbed many-branches~goToLineOnKey,8,W,wish~goToLineOnKey,12,E,eggs~goToLineOnKey,16,B,blood
this wish, this split thing cracks lightning
energy both moment and movement
inextricably interlocated
in many-branches~goToLineOnKey,12,M,man~goToLineOnKey,16,D,drip~goToLineOnKey,21,L,leaves
god-made man-made god made eggs &
their bedfellows nested in that slingshot Y
my striving too merely fissuring air
through many-branches~goToLineOnKey,16,B,blood~goToLineOnKey,21,C,clean~goToLineOnKey,1,S,sway
split lip’s blood drips to knuckles clipped
one heady rush is gulped, one breath taken
from the bridge linking boy
to gun to pathways of air 
spirals many-branches~goToLineOnKey,21,L,leather~goToLineOnKey,1,S,sway~goToLineOnKey,8,C,cracks
peel clean those leathered leaves
about a heart, sweet meat settling
between (new) teeth, a purple flower
carved by scuttling
down into many-branches~goToLineOnKey,1,S,sway~goToLineOnKey,8,C,cracks~goToLineOnKey,12,M,made
