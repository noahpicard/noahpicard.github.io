god swaying breeze-wise
light dappled capturing patches
‘cross lichen smattered sage-yellow
two scalloped twigs split infinite
wishbone - to make true is to fragment
but each bough rebonds to that broader trunk
dubbed many-branches~goToLineOnKey,8,W,wish~goToLineOnKey,13,E,eggs~goToLineOnKey,18,B,blood

this wish, this split thing cracks lightning
energy both moment and movement
inextricably interlocated
in many-branches~goToLineOnKey,13,M,man~goToLineOnKey,18,D,drip~goToLineOnKey,24,L,leaves

god-made man-made god made eggs &
their bedfellows nested in that slingshot Y
my striving too merely fissuring air
through many-branches~goToLineOnKey,18,K,knuckles~goToLineOnKey,24,C,clean~goToLineOnKey,30,S,stars

split lip’s blood drips to knuckles clipped
one heady rush is gulped, one breath taken
from the bridge linking boy
to gun to pathways of air 
spirals many-branches~goToLineOnKey,24,L,leather~goToLineOnKey,30,P,paper~goToLineOnKey,36,E,eyes

peel clean those leathered leaves
about a heart, sweet meat settling
between (new) teeth, a purple flower
carved by scuttling
down into many-branches~goToLineOnKey,30,R,rust~goToLineOnKey,36,P,paired~goToLineOnKey,42,S,swept

window-captured rust paper stars
cutlery settles on redwood slab
unbraiding table splitting threads
to various domicilies
marking many-branches~goToLineOnKey,36,T,through~goToLineOnKey,42,F,fickle~goToLineOnKey,47,C,crack

his eyes paired through
a grid of light in irises
redoubling back to an original hue
the lines radiating from pupil
as scared as many-branches~goToLineOnKey,42,Y,yellow~goToLineOnKey,47,S,slick~goToLineOnKey,53,F,fingers

the same fickle hand swept the yellow
river butterknife through dynasties as took hold
at the base of the seed as it split
upward into many-branches~goToLineOnKey,47,B,base~goToLineOnKey,53,G,glass~goToLineOnKey,59,R,rise

slick neck’s base cracks back
into place, a lapse in time
bubbles vacuum through vein
whose varicose meanderings
wander many-branches~goToLineOnKey,53,F,fondle~goToLineOnKey,59,O,origin~goToLineOnKey,65,C,casing

fingers glassed fondling green
mist in a stone, a gift from the river
the source of whom first drew breath
in a mantles tight-pack crevasse
pressure fissuring many-branches~goToLineOnKey,59,L,Latin~goToLineOnKey,65,S,scene~goToLineOnKey,71,A,arched

origin from the Latin oriri – to rise~italicWhere,oriri
a tongues tangle, the fatty taste imprinted
from this first dance partner, steps
wriggling back between helix strands
replicated across many-branches~goToLineOnKey,65,G,grains~goToLineOnKey,71,P,pale~goToLineOnKey,77,S,something

grains still recasing the scene
prints from his discarded sneakers
and the swell of water like a breath
out too long
walklines interleaving many-branches~goToLineOnKey,71,N,neck~goToLineOnKey,77,S,spine~goToLineOnKey,82,B,breeze

arched neck bared in pale fluorescence
his words seep carefully over chin
avoiding stains as he breathes
willing skin to retake bone in bondage
fibers binding many-branches~goToLineOnKey,77,C,carve~goToLineOnKey,82,B,bared~goToLineOnKey,88,L,lilies

she carves his spine something
curious, circumscribes her love 
counter clockwise as her sallow
palms finger into many-branches~goToLineOnKey,82,B,beach~goToLineOnKey,88,W,window~goToLineOnKey,95,G,gift

no breeze on his beach-bared back
falling forth iron crossed as if 
beating on the walls of Jericho or
gripping brick as if making to rebuild
clay fractures into many-branches~goToLineOnKey,88,W,wilting~goToLineOnKey,95,L,longer~goToLineOnKey,101,S,sage

windowside wilting lilies
we fill a cup with tea then lips
then air then rag the turning
fingers of loosened grips
the silent breaking sound
fragmenting along many-branches~goToLineOnKey,95,A,anticipation~goToLineOnKey,101,D,dusting~goToLineOnKey,107,C,crust

anticipation no longer the same gift
as those two teacups sitting sunside
filled loose with Tillandsia where
he had meant them cupboard fresh and slick
with words following many-branches~goToLineOnKey,101,S,shadow~goToLineOnKey,107,G,golden~goToLineOnKey,113,P,patter

a similar sage shadowy dusting
atop her carrion outstretch in
the burlap sack, soon gored
through by the mulberry tree
its roots inverting many-branches~goToLineOnKey,107,H,hillside~goToLineOnKey,113,B,broken~goToLineOnKey,119,L,low

this liminal hillside crusted golden
with waters memory, the rush of car
and clock counting her remaining breaths
still quiet crumpling, his roving chest
whose wrinkles spread many-branches~goToLineOnKey,113,F,feet~goToLineOnKey,119,D,drywall

wishbone broken, feet pattering down
terra-cotta at sunset, the unscrupulous
brussel sprouts, all marveling at his fathers
marbled sweet potato cheesecake
while outside waving many-branches~goToLineOnKey,119,M,melody

drywall dripping low melody god
absorbed in the image of light through her
nestled, warming to this silvery bedsheet, 
gold humming traffic and Kashi box beside
hand-in, a rustling like many-branches
