I know you asked me already



and I answered already but I feel
something needs to be flushed out in full
so, simply:


it is the brush on your fingers webbing
& in the fingertips brushing 
        it is the edges of film in the home video
        and thumb that gets in the shot
                it is the tune rolling tidally
                over behind your lips
                        it is the slimy clasped can
                        and the gloved hand
                                it is watching the stars to check
                                which ones might go out soon~replace,needs to be flushed out in full,is flushing me out
                                and thanking them for stopping by
        & it is the memory
        behind the memory~replace,([A-Za-z]+)ing\W,$1ed 
        a thousand times~replace,memory,memorymemorymemory
        the original true thing~replace,memory,memory

_~styleLine,24,color,blue~setLine,0,I know I’ve already answered
_~styleLine,23,color,blue~styleLine,22,color,blue~styleLine,21,color,blue~setLine,1,
_~styleLine,20,color,blue~setLine,2,you twice but since you asked I haven’t been able to stop
_~styleLine,19,color,blue~setLine,3,thinking about it
_~styleLine,18,color,blue~setLine,4,there was a strange echo in the base of your throat as you
_~styleLine,17,color,blue~setLine,5,		            enunciated
_~styleLine,16,color,blue~setLine,6,okay					                          something like
_~styleLine,15,color,blue~setLine,7,	  so              						                      this
_~styleLine,14,color,blue~setLine,8,			
_~styleLine,13,color,blue~setLine,9,                                            basically
_~styleLine,12,color,blue~setLine,10,                                            imagine a line turning into a field
_~styleLine,11,color,blue~setLine,11,                                            the sweeping expansion of that
_~styleLine,10,color,blue~setLine,12,                                            and the way it spreads along your
_~styleLine,9,color,blue~setLine,13,                                            chest to fill each space in your
_~styleLine,8,color,blue~setLine,14,                                            organells
_~styleLine,7,color,blue~setLine,15,
_~styleLine,6,color,blue~setLine,16,		             or if you 
_~styleLine,5,color,blue~setLine,17,     have trouble consider a
_~styleLine,4,color,blue~setLine,18,   broadknife carving away
_~styleLine,3,color,blue~setLine,19,      the dead skin from the
_~styleLine,2,color,blue~setLine,20,   base of your heel its soft
