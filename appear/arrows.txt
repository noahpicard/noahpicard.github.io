The following will precede disorderly:
you’ll follow the pink tape compassing posters
through lush grove and it’s gravestones
the mausoleum will rise before you
and a buzzed man with both senses
sprawled on the steps, when 
you tell him “I followed the arrows”
will nod/point both left and right


you’ll part the heavy medical cloth
into thunder – a staircase will quiver up-
wards to a mezzanine and past another 
cloth – wine will half-empty/roll into view
the benign arrangement spanning a laboratory’s
walls will effect a prayer


                                            – how holy these lips 
swelling with mothers milk                 – her body sallow and


tagged for processing         – the little stretching from skin
to canvas         – the green-grey-yellow-grey lines of tension


and your eyes will pass delicately through
the shrimp-like fist 
gripping the medical blanket


to the matte 
pink-grey paint carefully 
applied to the nails 
of her 
dehydrated hand
