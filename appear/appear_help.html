  <div style="white-space: pre;">
You can run an instruction on a particular line of the poem by adding it after the text with a tilde and with the arguments separated by commas. For example, to make the line:

  this is <span style="color: blue">blue text</span> and this is <span style="text-decoration: underline">lined text</span>

I would write something like:

  this is blue text and this is lined text~colorWhere,blue text,blue~underlineWhere,lined text
