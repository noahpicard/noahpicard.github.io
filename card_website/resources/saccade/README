Saccade
by Noah Picard

This is a small experience, which grew from the question:
"What would it be like to experience the digital directly?"
It draws from works of Barthes, Foucault, Cramer, and no doubt 
others, to analyze what the digital is and what it implies.
It also touches on my own curiosities.

To play the experience, simply open the file 'Saccade.html'
in a web browser. It is best viewed in full screen. Use the 
arrow keys to move the character forward onto the tiles, which 
flash with light each second.

The full text, comprised of a series of short poems, is also
available for viewing in the file 'FaccadeFullText.docx'.

I'd love to hear any feedback you have. Please email me at:

Enjoy!
