cmprsn
Compressing the electromagnetic spectrum
into the RGB, plus near infrared
we discover that after those boundaries
there is information lost
something which cannot be approximated
by any gaussian, and that stretching will
undoubtedly contrive other values into extremity


So there is loss in compression
we knew that- no big whup
compression of video  compression of chest
compression of photo compression of sound
compression of space        compression of real
