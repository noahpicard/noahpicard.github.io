The process of calculating a fractal dimension
whereupon we measure the dimension of a subject
based on the roughness implied at increasingly close
observations, scaling and swooping in with telescopes
glasses, microscopes, electron microscopes in order 
to ascertain the supposed limit of mass gain
over an infinite scaling- in a universe which is limitedly 
infinite; to be limitedly infinite is to be restrained
in dimension; to be splattered against a barrier of
higher dimension; to be limited by that obstruction and
thereby rendered smaller than possibility; or to use
that constraint as an excuse to spread infinite in all
other ways, an accelerated pouring into non-constraint
not stretching, nor pressing but growing with ease to
hug against this boundary; to love and respect its
edges; the process by which the splatterer and the
splattered achieve a mutual companionship; each
easing accelerated into those other infinites; each
parallel in their morphing, the boundaries by which
calculate a broader and rougher ______________
