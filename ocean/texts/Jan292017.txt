The Strandbeest
which is in itself a nomadic creature
centipede-stepping along the surf
where we observe thought-like structures
replaced by mechanical sensory structures
and must acknowledge that
if we believe something in the motion
and the reaction to be lifelike
then this samples a method of life
without thought
endlessly tracing the circuitous shoreline
grazing on the wind and
reeling back from the tide
programmed to wander (but never free)
blindly migrating from dune to dune
