The door slams have started up again in the corners of my vision
and I’m staring at the limey wall
       dry blinking so the corners feel 
tight like plastic bags
closing one eye         and then         closing the         other
the loose pedaled bass         drum
the music starts up
I Slump my shoulders and          the music starts up
I Count 
the veins on my hands                     in the laptop light
there are more  now  than  there  used  to-be
Reaching from wrist to 
latch onto every knuckle
Suckling from         every knuckle
   I’ve got to go now
the music is starting up
