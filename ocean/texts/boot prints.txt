boot prints


I found the little letters printed everywhere
On the back of postcards; 
In the corners of red-inked homework; 
Inside handles of steaming coffee mugs
And they spelled the same four words again and again
It was so dark that night, I couldn’t believe that my hand in front of my face still had an arm
Or by extension a person attached to it’s arm
Our brains are very good at connecting objects into patterns
Its how we’ve survived for so long
Off of table scraps and geometry
I saw hexagons in the corners of your lips as they curled up- in the dimples left there too
They stacked to fill the grid mapping my upper and lower lips
And the packing was dense
I left a lot of torn leaves in the fall floor when I walked around
Because my feet couldn’t grasp lightly, or smooth, or caress
But merely step through to the dirt again and again
Leaving boot prints
There’s a certain echo felt in brisk weather
We breathe it in and out we whisper heaps of small secrets
Spider webbing under our foggy exhale
So that they are all bouncing around- and turning the leaves red
Like meaning catches things alight
I suspect that’s where the little letters came from
And why they were hot to the touch
So that I became sensitive to their heat before I even turned postcard over to read them
The branding of unsaid- another phrasing of the cliche ‘burning questions’
Certain chemical structures lend themselves to hexagonal alignment
Given the inner valence angle of electrons
I wish I’d known that before I answered you
Before I ran my hand along the back of your neck- to the corners
And felt warmth under my fingertips
